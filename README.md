## Project Description

This app allows users to create, view, update, and delete tasks. Each task has a title, description, and priority level. The app features local data storage using an `sqflite` database, ensuring that all tasks are saved on the device.

The user interface includes a dynamic theme that can be switched between light and dark modes. The user's theme preference is saved locally using `shared_preferences` and is automatically applied when the app restarts.

The visual design is modern and clean, inspired by a "whiteboard" aesthetic, with an emphasis on good typography, clear layout, and intuitive user interaction.
